<h1>Data</h1>
<p>I have scraped the data in a seperate script. I have elected to use Steam data from user reviews. I am interested in comparing trends between reviews of games that have female protagonists versus games with male protagonists. Finding games with female protagonists was the hardest part, so I selected {list}. Then I selected games with male protagonists that I tried to map 1 to 1 with the female protagonist games (same year Â± 1, similar genre, etc.) as these are likely to be potentially confounding variables in comparison.</p>

Perfect remake of an already perfect game

I finally 100 this game, and Ive gotta say, its easily the best Resident Evil game for me. The upgraded graphics and eerie environments really pulled me in, and the gameplay was so much smoother than the original. Every boss fight had me on edge, but beating them was insanely satisfying. I loved the mix of tension, action, and exploration. Its definitely my favorite in the series!

10/10, worth my money. I almost gave 9/10 because of regenerador, Iron maiden and verdugo.

Know the feeling of a game getting announced that gets you very hyped? Its set to release two or three years from now and every time a new gameplay reveal or a trailer is released, you get hyped even more. The game looks absolutely amazing and your expectations are through the roof as you adore what you are presented. That is what playing Resident Evil 4 Remake feels like, except you arent watching any trailers or gameplay reveals. No. You are playing the finished and released product and experiencing the pure greatness of it all. I love the original. Its one of my most memorable childhood games and one of my favorite games of all time. Honestly, Im quite critical about the games I play. Even other games that I consider my all-time favorites have flaws that I cant ignore. But Resident Evil 4 Remake? I cant think of any. As far as my video game preferences go, Resident Evil 4 Remake is literal perfection. I really cannot find anything bad to say about this other than some cut parts that, to be frank, are better off not included. Its hard to think how Capcom will top this one because they took one of the greatest games of all time and made it greater tenfold. This is a masterpiece and definitely my GOTY of 2023.

Its a good remake. I know Crowbcat made a video saying this remake lacked soul, but I thought that was hyperbolic. This is a solid remake that takes the nostalgia you remember and adds nice extras. Plus, The Mercenaries is back!

Bought the first rocket launcher I saw in the shop and never once used it. Money well spent.

Edit: it WOULD be a fun remake if you could play it. Dont buy this shit. The fucking scope is HORRIBLE to look through. I spent 8 hours crashing, redoing settings. The default settings are not even built for a human to play. The whole 8 hours of my playtime was actually just being tabbed out on google and youtube trying to figure out what the fuck is up with the low FPS. EVEN THE MAIN MENU IS LOW FPS!! WTF? I even tried turning everything down. Ask anyone about the damn rifle scope... I got to the canyon and I couldnt even get past it because the game would freeze and crash from just seeing 4 buildings and 5 villagers.

First off, the graphics are good golly, brighter than a new penny and so detailed you can count the dust bunnies under the beds. The character models are the same deal, sharper than a tack and smoother than a greased weasel. The gameplay is real zippy; you know how some games can be as sluggish as a three-toed sloth? This one is not that! The setting is thicker than a bowl of oatmeal in a fog bank, and the tension is so palpable that each creepy creak and whisper has you looking over your shoulder. The story and plot twists are juicier than a ripe peach, and just when you think you have it all figured out, another curveball smacks you right in the kisser! The sound design is spine-tingling, like the gurgling groans of the infected. It is scorching hot! If you are looking to get lost in a world of gory doom, then this is for you!

I havent played the og fyi and this was amazing and I was really impressed with this and really think its a gem. I cant wait to play seperate ways. I have RE2 and got RE2 way before RE4 and I beat RE4 first; its clear that personally I find RE4 to be more fun gameplay wise and it definently had its scary moments. RE2s need to save items and conserve makes a harder and scarier experience imo. But RE4 is on offence and I appreciate that

Without changing much of the game-set settings on deck, the game performs and looks very good on the oled. Despite the main menu being 30 fps for some reason, in game its actually very high and over 60 fps most of the time. The battery life was also above around 2 hours which I personally think is pretty good for a game like this and my settings. Game is very good and fun with my only complaint being near the end, the amount of hard and tricky situations you get put in feels like it starts to happen way too much and too close to each other if that makes sense. Especially when I didnt feel like this for the entire game before this started happening. These situations lose its charm of being a challenge and just becomes annoying to get through especially when instead of breakables giving you actually helpful items, it gives you money you cant use at that moment

First of all: this is a fantastic remaster. Whether youre a fan of the original or have never played a Resident Evil game in your life, I wholeheartedly recommend RE4R. Ive put a couple hundred hours into the original on the PS2. There are a lot of differences between the original and the remake (besides the obvious). Some bits of the story have been rewritten, new areas added, and enemies changed or completely removed. Its not bothersome, but you shouldnt go in expecting a 1to1 remaster of the original. My first playthrough of the remake was on Veteran difficulty. The game kept me on the edge most of the time with just about enough resources to get by, but not enough to just breeze through. The balance was fantastic, and with the addition of the new parry, I got into an addictive flow of shooting, dodging, switching weapons, and parrying. A fantastic experience, and I cant wait to get into the next playthrough on Professional difficulty. Not all is perfect though. Some of the voicework in English, German, and Russian is a bit questionable. The decision to make the Seperate Ways gamemode paid DLC also angered a lot of people, which is understandable. The addition of crafting also didnt sit well with some people, but I personally didnt mind. Its beautiful, fluid, and challenging. In some areas easier than the original, in others much harder, but damn is it good.

Amazing remake, the best of the bunch. Im so glad they remade this. Leons my favourite character in the series. The original game was already a 10/10 game, especially with mods, and this is on par with it. The only two negative things I can say about it are the narrow field of view, even with the slider set to max, and Adas new voice actress. Everything else is near perfect.

Hands down, one of the greatest remakes ever made. Its more than a fresh coat of paint they expanded the game in every aspect. The parry system feels so good every time you pull it off. You can parry a chainsaw or even a sword. The majority of the game is split between horror and action sections, and its pulled off perfectly while the original was more action focused. Ashley doesnt require herbs anymore, and her AI is way better than the original. The charms are also a nice addition and Leons one-liners will never get old.

In the past I have played the re4 remakes but this is almost an entirely different game; different map layouts, weapon choices, crafting, knife durability, new enemies, and other new content galore. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes the horror thriller genre, and especially to those hesitant of another cash grab remake. This one is so much more than that

Game scales up as you go further. Harder enemies, more diverse locations, more fights, and you have to switch around your weapons and strategy depending on what you fight.

TL;DR: its a good modern game, but a bad remake. If you dont care about the original that much, youll have a great time. When Capcom announced Resident Evil 4 Remake, I thought to myself that if they transfer the combat mechanics from Remake 2 and Remake 3, i.e. headshots not having 100 stagger chance, clumsier movement, imprecise aiming, and so on, theyre going to ruin it. All of these aspects work for a survival horror, a slower type of game. Original Resi 4 is an action/arcade game which boasts predictability, crisp and precise movement and aiming. I wanted to give RE4R a chance. I lowered all my expectations and opened my mind. Surprisingly, for the first few chapters, I got sucked into the game. I grew to like parrying, even though it can be unreliable at times. Unfortunately, as the time went on, chapters passed, a feeling started to creep in. A question. Am I enjoying RE4R on its own merits, or because its a remake of Resident Evil 4?... ...and so began the downwards spiral. I started noticing changes to encounters and mechanics not because they would improve the game, but for the sake of it: The mentioned headshots having 100 stagger chance? Nerfed. Now headshotting is very unreliable, especially at higher difficulties. Knife is too powerful? Now it has durability which is so low that upgrading it is almost a must. Even then, youll need to pick up temporary knives so as not to go bankrupt from constant repairs. Whats worse, in RE4R its your primary defensive tool. If you have no knives left, youre sht out of luck. No wonder people rush to unlock Primal Knife, a bonus weapon which can be upgraded to have infinite durability. Tactical Vest reduces damage too much? Now it can straight up completely block some damage, but is made of tissue paper and breaks after a few harder hits. Of course, repairing it very expensive. Its good only for boss fights and Professional mode. Game too easy after people learned to aim well? Now instead of creeping up on you, enemies straight up rush you, and their grabs have insane tracking. Being hit by a heavy attack does not grant you any i-frames, so you can be stunlocked to death. Leon is slow as are all his reloads. Parrying is required for defense, but Leon needs a few frames to be able to parry at all, so if you start aiming, or reloading, or changing your weapon, you cannot parry, especially at close range. This is very noticeable on Professional. At least they removed QTEs, right? Not really, they reduced them, but lets be honest: parrying is a sort of QTE. Evading literally is one, as a prompt is displayed on the screen. But oh, they added stealth! Except it works exactly like in The Evil Within, which was criticized for the simplistic, low effort way it was implemented. Back in 2014. There are some good changes, but most of them are tied to atmosphere and character writing. Completely unnecessary remake. A product of remake culture, purely for the money. I didnt even bother playing Separate Ways DLC. It can be fun, since its Resident Evil 4 at heart. Good game, but a bad remake. Buy only on sale.

Worth every penny. Resident Evil 4 Remake is a masterclass in how to modernize a game while still maintaining the core of what made the original so special. The OG RE4 is one of my favorite games of all time, and I was originally skeptical of the remake, but Capcom managed to keep everything that made the 2005 classic a timeless masterpiece while adding to the game and making smart changes to certain parts. They managed to retain the intensity and atmosphere of the original, and elevated them thanks to modern graphics and improved gameplay mechanics. In terms of gameplay, everything you know and love from the OG is present in the remake in its full glory, with the added mechanics of stealth and the knife parry adding new ways to approach combat encounters (The parry mechanic is by far my favorite thing added in the remake). Since the tank controls were removed in place of traditional third person movement, it allows for greater mobility in combat. To compensate for improved mobility, the enemy AI has been revamped to make the ganados more aggressive during combat and allows them to coordinate their attacks to swarm the player if they arent careful. Due to all these changes, gunfights are far more intense in the original, and somehow make the perfect gameplay loop of the original even better. The story carries a more serious and sinister tone this time around, but Capcom did a great job adapting the story to this new tone while still maintaining the B-movie camp of the original title. Many of Leons classic one liners are maintained, while plenty of new ones are added. Some characters, such as Ashley and Luis, are given huge upgrades compared to their original counterparts. Many parts of the lore are fleshed out and expanded upon. The only downside with the writing is that certain characters, primarily Salazar and Saddler, are a downgrade compared to the original. Salazar in particular went from being one of the best characters in the original to forgettable in the remake. Overall though, the story is an upgrade from the original, even if I may prefer the more campy tone of the original. Overall, RE4 Remake is the perfect example of a modern remake done right. It maintains everything that made the original game special while adding on to it in ways that make sense. It sets a new standard for survival action horror games, and is a masterpiece in every single way. This is easily my favorite game from 2023. Final Rating: ILL BUY IT AT A HIGH PRICE 10/10

I was so excited for RE4 Remake when it was first announced. I mean like a lot of people, its my favorite game ever made. I had so much faith in Capcom that they would nail it out of the park. Thank God they did because my heart wouldve shattered into a million pieces. My favorite game of all time got remade perfectly. I cannot express how grateful I am from being able to feel the exact same way as I did when I first played the original. Buy the game, buy separate ways dlc. Heck even take time to download some mods and randomize the game up if you want. The game is amazing, and you just have to see for yourself. Enjoy. This game goes down in history, and sits proudly on top with the original game.

10/10 - Masterpiece Resident Evil 4 Remake completely eclipses its predecessor and modernizes a beloved classic. Capcom perfectly blends action horror gameplay and adds tons of depth, mechanics, and replayability from the original. The story is revamped, adding more depth and nuance to characters, especially Ashley, Ada, and Luis. Capcom does a great job modernizing the dialogue and storytelling without losing the campy charm that defined the original. Leon is much more agile, making dodging, parring, and countering very responsive. The enemies are more aggressive and that added much needed tension to encounters. I was most impressed by the graphics. The visual overhaul on the RE Engine is stunninglighting, textures, and environmental detail are meticulously crafted to create an atmosphere thats both beautiful and deeply unsettling. While the over-the-shoulder camera adds intensity to the action, at times it feels a bit too close to Leon, especially in tight spaces. This can occasionally obstruct your view of incoming enemies or obstacles, making certain encounters feel more claustrophobic than intended. However, it doesnt detract significantly from the overall experience, as the games tension thrives on these moments of close-quarters combat. Resident Evil 4 Remake is absolutely worth playing whether youre a longtime fan or a newcomer to the series.

Remember resident evil 4 from your childhood ? try to look for a gameplay video, the graphic is actually not as good and as realistic as how you remember it. However this game is it, it is exactly RE4 in the graphic quality that you remember (or how you imagine the original RE4 is i suppose). Plus you got some more challenge, less cringy dialogue and general quality of life improvements like attack blocking with knife.

Im a huge fan of Resident Evil and my favourite was Resident Evil 4. When this remake came out I thought it was so much better than the original and this game is by far my favourite game ever. This game did a good job with staying to the original story except for cutting out the U3 boss in Leons story which I think makes a lot of sense. In the original the U3 kind of just felt like an unnecessary road block that didnt really make sense to have as a boss. Overall I feel like the story is cleaned up more than the original game. The gameplay feels so much better than the original and the combat really makes Leon feel like a special agent. I really like the new parry system with the knife and it feels really great to parry things almost every attack. It also really makes Krausers boss fight feel much better since in the original you were going up against a fast solider who has been messing with bio-weapons to make him stronger, but you play as a very stiff Leon having to fight Krauser with tank controls. I think the Mercenaries was also very well done and I so glad they made Luis a playable character in this mini-game. It would have been nice to have Ashley in the Mercenaries and have her lantern kill the Ganados. If you own this game but havent bought Separate Ways yet then please get on it. This DLC was so much for fleshed out than how the original Separate Ways just reused a lot of areas from the Leons story. In my opinion I think that Ada is much better to play as because she as the added ability of using the grapple gun on enemies. I also like that all the things that were cut from Leons story was added into Separate Ways to fit the spy theme of this DLC. If your thinking about getting this game then I think you definitely should. I think you would be missing out on an amazing game.

Best game made in a while! Had a ton of fun! You can play any weapon you like say: Base gun, Matilda, SkullShaker, Riot Shotgun, Bolt action sniper, Red 9, TPMP...etc (except Crossbow which...wooooorks? kinda?? but requires alot of prep) until the end. Best Parry mechanic in any RE game, very accurate real-time hitbox (one of the best ive rarely seen as it follows your character to the inch) soundtrack is phenomenal, exploding Ganado heads never felt so satisfying, it honored the OG if you are nostalgic. The Hardest Professional difficulty isnt just ramp up of enemy damage and health (looking at you Village of Shadows) you get different enemy placements, new saves placements, some different enemy spawns, AI becomes more aggressive, early full tune-up access, more expansive Merchant items, and more rewards. It teaches you to use your environment which you would normally brush off quickly on standard difficulties since your loaded(such as explosive barrels, burning lanterns, molotov and dynamite that enemies throw at you to your advantage) to save as much ammo as possible for when you REALLY need them! Satisfying gameplay that rewards skillful plays and unlockable weapons and constumes adds alot to the replayability,(especially if you got the Separate Ways DLC). Mercenaries is the only iffy thing because it is limited to 150 kills but i guess you could fix that with mods. If you enjoy the game dont forget to try a randomizer and enjoy being in a mess :P. Anyway Have fun!

People will probably want to burn me for this, but after all the hype about the best resident evil getting a remake I just expected something ... different? Dont get me wrong, its a fantastic remake and a great game, I just didnt enjoy it at all. Leons movements are slow, while the enemy ones are faster and the camera angle is just atrocious. Also ... I know Leon is a handsome guy, but did his back really have to take up 1/3 of the screen all the time? I dont know .... maybe its a me-problem, but after the first half I just wanted the game to finally end. Felt more like a hord shooter than a resident evil.

This game is literally broken in an extremely blatant way. You cannot even delete your saves. I know that sounds hard to believe but its true. And who would even care about that right, I mean whatever? Oh, except for the fact that theres a bug in the game that makes it take longer and longer to start up the more save slots are used until youre waiting almost 5 minutes every time you start the game. Not only that but you used to be able to trick steam into letting you delete files and not have the cloud re-download them, but Capcom seems too have decided to break the game even more so now if you want to delete even just 1 save you have to delete everything including every achievement and unlockable in the game. Of course Capcom will probably keep doing this garbage in the future because everyone gave the game great reviews anyway not caring that it is literally BROKEN. The game isnt even that good anyway, just okay,or maybe its just that Capcom being trash soured me on the whole experience.

A very solid remake. What they did for a remake of a cheesy, yet lovable classic from 05 was pretty damn good in terms of a more serious re-telling. Granted, a lot of classic lines, weapons like the PRL-412, and loads of other things and such were omitted, but some of it was given a nod or two, whether via dialogue or an achievement. (sadly, it cant be said for the PRL.) And they did Luis and Ashleys characters SO much justice. Way more development and attachment to them than in the original. (Not that the original didnt try to do that, of course.) As for how combat, weapons, and enemies go? WAY more faster than the original, Ill admit. But once you get the hang of it, prepare to kick ass. SOLID 10/10. If you loved the original, Id say give this a try, too.

I love the original, Ive played it multiple times across PC and consoles, and the remake is super good and faithful. I feel like, besides a few things I loved in the original, like the ride to the Mendez fight, a lot of it was done justice and some things were even improved, like the El Gigante fight at the castle being in the castle as a hide-and-seek sort of section instead of just being a section where you run from it in a canyon. There are so many references, and my biggest thing is how the game gives YOU the power in scenes that, in the original, were just cutscenes. For instance, the Krauser fight - You have to fight him with your knife and it is RAW. In the original, if you remember, it was all QTEs. This carries through to little features, like how you can shoot the communication devices Salazar uses in the castle. Leon only did that once in a cutscene, but now you can do it if you dont want to hear his dialogue, which feels promising for future replays. Final thing; THE MERCENARIES. OUGH, this is an amazing mode. I love the RE4 Mercenaries but it felt like a gimmick. Even with similar maps, and the same amount of maps, Mercenaries is RAW. It goes so hard. I love it. I love how the character choice feels more important - If I play Hunk I can tear through enemies but Im not as defensive as I am offensive, if I play as Krauser Im not too good on firearms or ammunition but that knife can OBLITERATE enemies. Anyway, all I can think about is playing more of this remake. Truly a 10/10 experience... minus, yknow... a certain voice that doesnt fit a certain character as it lacks any expression or personality... but that isnt a world-ending issue.

Bro why cant I just buy the treasure DLC separately, instead I have to buy the gold editon for half of the price of the regular re4r?

great game that brings back such a childhood memory when i played it on ps 2. Although there are some elements are added in the game but it still does not delete the main essence of the game

This game I played when Resident Evil 4 came out in my teens since the PS2 era and I played it over and over again but now with the new remake this game is something quite new and mixes with the gameplay style from Resident Evil 2 and Village and it hits different with the new story and the direction of Luis Sera other than an side character and add more screen time and way better experience and faithful to the original and same thing with the separate ways and reminded me some throwbacks and also a veteran from Resident Evil 4 gamer. This game is recommended for old and new resident evil fans. missed those cheesy lines and brought the f-bomb lol and Ashley is way better than the classic. and time to put some John Wick moves

Resident Evil 4 (2005) is often regarded as the best RE game. From changing to a completely different camera style, to revolutionizing how action and survival games are played, Capcom persists at developing some of the most captivating gameplay with Resident Evil 4 (2023). I freakin love this game, bro.

The game is good, dont get me wrong! but, its the stupid little annoyances that bring this game down. The hit box is so bad that you miss your shots all the time, even when the enemy is right in front of you. Please dont waste your time trying to parry, I think it only works around 20 of the time, which is just slightly better than how often the dodge works. Ive tried to play more, but I think im just going to uninstall the game, come to the conclusion, I just cannot be bothered to play it! I am so disappointed.

Its a hit or miss, but mods make the game play interesting. Big miss on the lack of resources and the short amount of time to beat the game. Honestly this was a downfall on beating the game less then 5 half hours, they should of made a score based time so you actually play the game, it takes time but you can beat the game on professional with killing all enemies in less then 5 half hours, but pretty close to the S+ just missing that time to reach. All you need is 3 or 4 weapons and make use of you resources but for me some areas I had lil or no ammo but possible. Took quite a bit of time but I had my 1st weapon upgraded max out by chapter 10 with the rest a mix of damage upgraded more often then any other stats at level 1 to 3. Mods make it interesting and I really the 2005 OG which is why I got the 2023 version, and the graphics are one of the perks that made me enjoy and hate the game, or watch the different death animations.

One of the most fun games i have ever played, i regret not picking this game up sooner since it has become my number 1 singeplayer game, i can see myself coming back to this game with how much replayability there is in this game even with 47 hours on this game i still havent done everything that there is to do and i should probably mention that mods exist and extend that replayability level. i would explain how great this game is in every way shape or form but i wanna avoid spoiling the soul reading my review rn so please just pick up the game if you can and experience this master piece for yourself.

GREAT! Everything I expected and more! Leon, Ashley, Luis, Ada, GREAT! Anyone who agrees should comment duo. Edit: Ive played a bit more and... IT GOT EVEN BETTER! Without these amazing twists what would even happen? Great game. Best game I have a Steam. There are only like five bad reviews and one of them is bad because you never get to see Ashleys panties like you could in the original. Well, at least she isnt just a tiny model with a flat, very, VERY dull material. He also complained that you couldnt look up into her skirt and watch her yank it down and yell, pervert! at you. Even though, she was quite right about the person who wrote that review. For the record both Leon and Ashley look MUCH better. And he shouldnt have anything against the Dev(s), because for some reason everyone if deeply, deeply attracted to Ada, who I, personally dont really like. Shes fine, but, meh. Behavior, okay. Voice, not really good. Looks, no. I dont know why. Luis Serra is probably one of my favorites. Some of the voice lines through, like, the first half of the game were kinda flat. Overall, 10/10. Edit: why did you tell me to shoot all the fish in the water? Edit: kudos to whoever got this far.
